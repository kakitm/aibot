# Default System Instructions
# =============================================================================

# This file defines default system instructions for each Discord slash command.
# These instructions serve as fallbacks when custom instructions are disabled
# or restricted via the lock command - making them critical configuration.

# To use this configuration, rename this file to "default.yml".
#
# Use command names (e.g., chat, fixme) as keys and write
# the corresponding system instructions below.
